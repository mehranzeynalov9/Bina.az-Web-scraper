# Bina.az-Web-scraper
This is a Python web scraping code that uses the Selenium library to scrape data from a real estate website. The code navigates to the site, clicks on the "Detailed Search" button, selects a district, and extracts data from each page. The code is designed to disable image loading for faster browsing and stores the scraped data in lists.
